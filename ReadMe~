TEA - calculates Thermochemical Equilibrium Abundances of chemical species 

TEA is part of the PhD dissertation work of Dr. Jasmina                 
Blecic, who developed it with coding assistance from                    
undergraduate M. Oliver Bowman and under the advice of                  
Prof. Joseph Harrington at the University of Central Florida,           
Orlando, Florida, USA.
